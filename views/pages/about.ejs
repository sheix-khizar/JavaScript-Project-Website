            Hey, Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re here! This site is where I share the projects I build while learning and exploring the world of JavaScript.
<br>
<br>
            This site is all about getting better through hands-on practice â€” not just reading tutorials, but actually building stuff. From small UI components to more complete apps, everything here is designed to sharpen my skills, try new ideas, and have a bit of fun along the way.
<br>
<br>        
            If youâ€™re here to learn, feel free to explore the projects, dig into the code, and use whatever helps you. Iâ€™ll be updating the site regularly with new builds, challenges, and experiments as I grow as a developer.
<br>
<br>        
            And hey â€” if youâ€™re looking for someone who loves writing clean, functional JavaScript and isnâ€™t afraid to tackle real-world problems,
            I'm open to work. ðŸ‘€
<br>
<br>        
            Thanks for checking out my work! ðŸš€
